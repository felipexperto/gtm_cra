# Google Tag Manager com Create React App

## O que é este repositório?

Este repositório visa apresentar de maneira simples e enxuta uma solução para implementação de Google Tag Manager ( `GTM` ) em Single Page Applications utilizando `Create React App` com objetivo de evitar problemas comuns.

## A Estrutura

- Arquivos envs com códigos de GTM diferentes: `.env`, `.env.production`, `.env.staging`;
- Arquivo `config/index.js` que expõe as variáveis de ambiente para utilização;
- Arquivo `utils/gtm/index.js` que contém o helper de inserção do GTM;
- Arquivo `components/Root` que implementa o `react-router-dom` para mudança de rotas e insere script do GTM;
- Arquivo `components/App` que inicia o objeto de datalayer, contém a declaração das rotas e as observa;
- Arquivos `components/Home`, `components/ReactPresentation`, `components/VuePresentation` servem como "páginas" na alternância de rotas;


## Rodando o projeto

1. Clone o repositório;
2. Instale as dependências rodando o comando `yarn`;
3. Rode o projeto com `yarn start`;
4. Acesse a url: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open  to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
